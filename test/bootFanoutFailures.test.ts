// Boot fans out over four independent reads — summary, recent-bundle, validators,
// folders — and each one ends in `.catch(() => null)`. Those four swallows are a
// deliberate degradation policy: one failed read must not stop the sidebar
// appearing. Nothing pinned any of it. Measured 2026-08-21: all four `.catch`
// clauses could be deleted, and two of them could be changed to paint an EMPTY
// result instead of no result, with the whole 523-test suite staying green.
//
// ⚠️ The two halves are separate claims and both are tested below, because a swallow
// has two ways to be wrong and they fail in opposite directions:
//
//   drop the catch     -> the rejection reaches Promise.all, boot() rejects, and the
//                         SSE handshake that boot() gates never starts. One flaky read
//                         takes the whole client down.
//   swallow too much   -> the failure is painted as an EMPTY SUCCESS. A sidebar that
//                         could not load is then indistinguishable from an account
//                         with no sessions, which is the `d80db401` defect shape.
//
// The empty-success half is why every test here SEEDS the store first and asserts the
// seeded rows SURVIVE. Asserting "the store is empty after a failed read" would pass
// for both the correct behaviour and the bug.
