// key/value store exists, and both persisted stores (draftStorage, filterStorage)
// take their answer from it. Until this file existed it had NO test at all: the
// whole body could be replaced with `return null` and the suite stayed green, so
// every one of its four `null` producers was free to disappear unnoticed.
//
// It answers null for four different reasons, and the reasons are not
// interchangeable — each guards a different way for storage to be absent-or-broken.
// So the tests below are written per PRODUCER, not per outcome: each pins one
// reason by arranging a world where that reason is the ONLY one that fires, and
// where deleting it hands back a storage the caller would then trust.
//
// Two of the four cannot be pinned alone, and the tests say which and why rather
// than covering it over — see `the two producers no assertion can tell apart`.
