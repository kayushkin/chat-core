// The in-memory transcript store used to be unbounded. `turnsBySession` and `tails`
// were only ever removed from by `removeSession` — a SERVER-SIDE delete — so every
// session the user opened stayed in memory in full for the life of the tab.
//
// That is backwards from the layer below it: the IndexedDB cache has been bounded at
// `DEFAULT_CACHE_LIMIT` (50) since it was written, so L2 was capped and L1 was not.
//
// The cost is not theoretical. Measured against the live box on 2026-08-25, over the
// 40 most recent sessions, one `GET /sessions/{id}/messages?limit=30` page is 1.06 MB
// of JSON at the median and 10.1 MB at the worst, and the cold-boot
// `recent-bundle?n=20&turns=30` is 29.1 MB in a single response. A parsed object graph
// runs several times its wire size once string headers, the `turnIndex` Map and the
// per-entry `Set<number>` in `TailState` are counted, so a few dozen opens is a heap
// in the hundreds of megabytes — the reported growing lag (major GC over a heap that
// only grows) and then the tab crash.
//
// `limit` is a bound on MESSAGES, not on bytes: 30 messages carrying big tool results
// is 10 MB. So the page bound cannot stand in for a retention bound, and these cases
// pin the retention bound directly.
//
// Written against the OBSERVABLE store, the same way `listCacheBound.test.ts` is: the
// bug was never in a pure helper, it was that nothing evicted anything.
