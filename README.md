# @kayushkin/chat-core

Framework-light data layer for the **dashv2** chat surface. The client renders from memory;
the network only reconciles in the background. Powers sub-10ms session switching, a warm
cache of the most-recent sessions, optimistic mutations, and **non-destructive** OTel/rollout
dedup (every source is kept and auditable — dedup only annotates the collapsed view).

- Wire contract (Go ↔ TS): [`docs/WIRE.md`](docs/WIRE.md)
- Public API (what the page consumes): [`docs/PUBLIC-API.md`](docs/PUBLIC-API.md)

The backends this client talks to are their own repos:
[llm-bridge-server](https://github.com/kayushkin/llm-bridge-server) (gateway and SSE),
[llm-bridge](https://github.com/kayushkin/llm-bridge) (canonical message types),
[log-store](https://github.com/kayushkin/log-store) (event history and search) and
[noteboard](https://github.com/kayushkin/noteboard) (the items behind ref chips).
The dashv2 architecture and performance-baseline documents live in the `dash` repo,
which is not public.

## Layers
```
L0 render memo   virtualization + per-turn React.memo
L1 hot store     Zustand Maps: working set of sessions' TurnModels — every action renders here
L2 IndexedDB     persists L1 → cold boot paints with 0 network
   localStorage  composer drafts + the sidebar's filter selection — both read SYNCHRONOUSLY at
                 store construction. A draft has to be in the first paint or an async hydrate
                 races the typing; a filter has to be, or the list paints unfiltered and then
                 pulls rows out from under someone already reading it
   sync engine   1 list-SSE + 1 active-SSE + validator sweep → applies deltas, silent repair
L3 server cache  (in llm-bridge-server) serialized+compressed list & bundle
L4 SQLite        bridge.db + log-store events.db — source of truth
```

## Modules
```
src/store/   ChatStore (Zustand) + selectors + draftStorage (composer drafts → localStorage)
             + filterStorage (the six filter axes → localStorage; search/folder deliberately not)
             + webStorage (the one localStorage probe both of those take)
src/reduce/  TurnReducer (live tail, Map-indexed) + otelDedup (annotator) + refChips
src/cache/   SessionCache (IndexedDB via idb) + evict (two LRU bounds: ~50 sessions'
             turns, and the list store to one sidebar page — its only reader is the
             cold-boot paint, which is one page wide)
src/sync/    SyncEngine + sse
src/net/     ApiClient + types (wire contract)
src/boot/    Prefetcher (boot sequence + hover/idle prefetch)
src/react/   ChatProvider + hooks (the public API)
```
