// Boot sequence (§6) + hover/idle prefetch. The boot order is the whole latency

// parallel reads. Hover/idle prefetch warms a cold session before the click so a
// select() is a Map read.
//
// HOW THE SIDEBAR'S WINDOW FILLS.
//
// 1. The boot page is FILTERED by whatever the sidebar's chips are set to, which
//    `createChatStore()` has already restored from localStorage before the first
//    paint. The page is a strict newest-first prefix, so on this box an unfiltered
//    one is spent on machine traffic; filtering server-side is what makes the first
//    page relevant rather than merely recent.
//
// 2. Changing a chip fetches the first page of the NEW filter (`refilter`). The
//    local sieve still applies at once over the rows already held; the page makes
//    sure the newest rows that match are among them.
//
// 3. Older pages come on request — scrolling to the end or the "Load older sessions"
//    button — always for the filter currently set.
//
// 4. A content-search hit whose session is not loaded is fetched by id
//    (`loadSessionsByIds`), so a hit is shown rather than counted as hidden.
//
// This replaced a background loop that paged 20 times at every boot, 2,000 sessions,
// so that chip clicks and search could sieve locally. It cost 20 requests and a full
// sidebar recompute per page on every page load, and still missed older matches.
