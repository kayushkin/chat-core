// Session signals — the canonical record of anything a session surfaces to a
// human: a question that needs an answer, or a notification that needs at most
// an acknowledgement. Canonical Go type: llm-bridge `msg/signal.go`; read API:
// llm-bridge-server `internal/server/signals.go`.
//
// This file is the wire edge for that record: the snake_case shape the server
// sends, the camelCase shape chat-core renders from, and the mapping between
// them. It sits in its own module rather than in `types.ts` + `wireEvents.ts`
// because a signal is BOTH — the same record is read over HTTP and grouped for
// display — and splitting six small types across two files to honour a
// file-per-direction rule would leave nowhere to put `groupSignalsByRequest`,
// which is the one piece of signal logic every surface needs and none of them
// should re-derive.
//
// Read path: GET {basePath}/signals?state=open&surface=chat[&session_id=…].
//
// The per-session route GET /sessions/{id}/signals exists too, but everything
// here deliberately uses the cross-session route: the per-session route answers
// 404 for BOTH "this server has no signals route" and "no such session", and
// those two need different handling. /signals only 404s for the first, so the
// answer is unambiguous.
