// The verbs that close a signal. Ported from bridge-ui's `signalData.ts`, which
// is the working v1 of this feature.
//
// They live in `store/` rather than on `ApiClient` because answering a signal is
// ORCHESTRATION, not one request: the tool path reads the parked hook back
// before it writes (see `resolveSignalQuestions`), and the derived path resolves
// through an entirely different endpoint. `ApiClient` stays a thin, honest
// pass-through over each individual route; the decision about which route
// answers which signal is here, once, for every surface that renders a card.

/** Every mounted signal surface reads the same records, so a resolve on one has
 *  to reach the others: answering in a sidebar inbox while a RefChip panel is
 *  open on the same session otherwise leaves the panel offering a question that
 *  is already answered. There is no signal event on the SSE stream yet, so the
 *  verbs below announce it in-process and every subscriber refetches.
 *
 *  This is a refetch trigger, NOT a cache — each surface still asks the server
 *  what is open, so the server stays the single source of truth for state. */
