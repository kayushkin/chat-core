// Composer drafts, persisted across a reload.
//
// WHY localStorage AND NOT the IndexedDB SessionCache (the decision this file records):
// a draft has to be on screen in the first paint, and IndexedDB cannot promise that.
// `SessionCache.hydrate()` resolves after the provider mounts, so an IndexedDB-backed
// draft would land in the box some frames AFTER the user could already be typing into
// it — either clobbering the new keystrokes or being clobbered by them, depending on
// which write won. `localStorage.getItem` is synchronous, so `createChatStore()` can
// return with the drafts ALREADY in its initial state and that race cannot happen.
// Drafts are also a few kilobytes of plain text, which is what localStorage is for;
// the reasons SessionCache exists (megabytes of materialized turns, structured
// queries, an LRU over them) do not apply.
//
// The whole record is rewritten on each keystroke rather than debounced. A debounce
// buys back microseconds of a synchronous stringify over a few kilobytes and costs the
// last words typed before a reload — which is the one thing this file exists to keep.
