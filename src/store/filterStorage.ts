// The sidebar's filter selection, persisted across a reload.
//
// WHAT IS PERSISTED, AND WHAT DELIBERATELY IS NOT. Only the six faceted axes
// (`harness`, `status`, `type`, `purpose`, `mode`, `machine`) survive a reload.
//
//   - `search` is NOT persisted. A restored query would re-run a transcript search
//     against the gateway on every page load and hand the user a short list whose
//     cause is a sentence they typed days ago and cannot see. bridge-ui does not
//     persist its search box either.
//   - `folder` is NOT persisted. It is a navigation position, not a chip: restore a
//     folder that has since been deleted and the sidebar is empty with nothing on
//     screen saying why.
//
// ⚠️ THE SHAPE IS chat-core's OWN, AND THAT IS THE DECISION THIS FILE RECORDS.
// bridge-ui persists the same idea as EXCLUSION sets — "hide these" — under eight
// keys of its own (`bridge-ui-harness-filter`, `bridge-ui-session-type-filter`, …).
// chat-core's `FilterState` is INCLUSION arrays: OR within an axis, AND across axes,
// empty meaning no filter at all. Reading bridge-ui's keys here would invert the
// meaning of every filter — an empty exclusion set ("show everything") would arrive
// as an empty inclusion array, which happens to agree, and a one-element exclusion
// set ("hide claude-code") would arrive as "show ONLY claude-code", which is the
// exact opposite. So this store writes chat-core's own inclusion arrays under its own
// key and the two surfaces diverge on purpose. They also share an origin — dash
// serves bridge-ui's chat at `/` and dashv2 at `/dashv2` — so a shared key would not
// merely be ambiguous, it would have the two pages overwriting each other.
//
// Like `draftStorage.ts`, this is read back SYNCHRONOUSLY inside `createChatStore()`
// so the restored filter is in the very first painted state. An async rehydrate would
// paint the unfiltered list first and then yank rows out from under a user who has
// already started reading.
