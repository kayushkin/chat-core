   *
   *  ⛔ RESUMING FROM THE PAGE INSTEAD WAS TRIED AND WITHDRAWN on 2026-08-27, the day it
   *  shipped. The store still carries `streamResumeBySession` and the server still sends
   *  `StreamResumePoint` — both are correct and are what a second attempt needs — but
   *  nothing reads them here, deliberately. Read this before wiring them up again.
   *
   *  It worked, by its own measure: 8 of 8 cold opens connected with a resume point and
   *  the current-turn replay went from 5,569 KB to 0 across eight opens. It also DOUBLED
   *  NARRATION in the UI, and the cause is structural rather than a slip.
   *
   *  The server reads the stream head BEFORE flushing pending log-store writes, which is
   *  what guarantees no event is lost — and it also means the page may contain events
   *  ABOVE that head, written while the flush ran. Those are re-delivered on the stream.
   *  Page entries are keyed `e_<log-store row id>` and live ones `${messageId}_${kind}`
   *  or `evt_<bridge row id>`, so the two never collide by id: overlap is reconciled by
   *  CONTENT, in `mergeMaterializedPage`, which only runs when a page lands OVER a live
   *  tail. Resuming from a page inverts that order and nothing reconciles the other way.
   *  On an actively streaming session the window is wide.
   *
   *  No ordering avoids both failures. Reading the head after the flush closes the
   *  duplication window and opens a LOSS window in its place — an event written in
   *  between sits at or below the head while never reaching log-store, so it appears on
   *  neither the page nor the resumed stream and nothing reports it missing. Duplication
   *  is the safer half, which is why it was chosen; it still has to be handled.
   *
   *  WHAT WOULD MAKE IT SHIPPABLE: the reducer reconciling live-over-page as well as
   *  page-over-live. The keys already exist in `pageReports`. The trap is naive skipping
   *  by `messageId` — a `stream` or `block` frame above the head is genuinely NEW text
   *  for a message the page already holds, and dropping it loses streamed content. The
   *  atomic kinds (`system`, `tool_call`, `tool_result`, `result`, `user_message`) can be
   *  skipped on a content match; the appending kinds cannot. */
