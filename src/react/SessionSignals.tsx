 * own permission banner was already drawing from the live tool input. That prop
 * was the last place a client still had to know which producer raised a
 * question. It is gone because the duplication it worked around is: the record
 * now carries `allowMultipleOptions`, which was the one thing the banner could
 * render and the card could not, so a host has no reason left to draw a second
 * form for a question that is already on this one.
 *
 * Ported from bridge-ui's `SessionSignals.tsx`.
