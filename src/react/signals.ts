// a passive linkification of an id, so one transcript can mount many chips on
// the SAME session, and every open panel would otherwise put its own /signals
// request on the wire. Loads therefore go through a short-lived promise cache
// keyed by session id and the duplicates share one flight.
//
// It is NOT `refDetail.ts`'s cache, and not because of where the code lives: a
// chip detail is read-only and can simply age out, while a signal is ANSWERED
// from the surface that displays it. This cache has to be invalidated the
// instant a resolve lands anywhere in the tab, which is what
// `subscribeToSignalChanges` delivers and what a pure TTL cannot.
