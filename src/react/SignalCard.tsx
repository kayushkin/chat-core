              between them on `requestId`. That is evidence the card does not
              have: a requestId says a park EXISTED, not that it is still live.

              that could not work, and never offered the one that could.
              The server picks now: dismissing a live park denies its tool call,
              and dismissing anything else closes the row. */}
