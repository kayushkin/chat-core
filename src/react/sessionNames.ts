// Resolving a session id to the name a human calls it, for a surface that holds
// ids and nothing else.
//
// Every other surface in this package already has the `SessionSummary` in hand —
// a sidebar row renders one, a header renders one — so none of them ever needed
// this. The cross-session signals inbox is the first that does: it lists open
// signals, and a signal carries `session_id` and no name at all.
//
// Paging cannot answer it. The sidebar loads a newest-first prefix, and a
// session that raised a question and then went quiet sinks out of that prefix
// while its question stays open — which is precisely the case the inbox exists
// for. Measured on this host: of the 17 sessions holding an open chat signal,
// 11 were nowhere in the sidebar's first page.

 *
 * ⚠️ The fallback is the SESSION ID, never a placeholder like "Untitled" or
 * "Unknown session". An id is ugly and it is true — it is what the session is
 * called when nobody has named it, and it is still enough to tell two cards
 * apart and to search for. A friendly placeholder would make every unnamed
 * session look like the same session.
 *
 * Three tiers, cheapest first:
 *   1. the store — anything the sidebar has already loaded, free
 *   2. the name cache — anything a previous inbox render resolved
 *   3. one batched `GET /sessions/summary?session_id=…` for whatever is left
 *
 * A failed lookup is NOT surfaced as an error. The caller is rendering a
 * question that needs answering; falling back to the id keeps that card usable,
 * whereas an error banner over the inbox would hide the very thing it exists to
 * show.
