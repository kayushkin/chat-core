# chat-core public API

The surface the dashv2 page consumes. The client implementation (`src/react/*`, `src/store/*`)
must export exactly these; the dash page imports only these. Kept stable so the page and the
library can be built in parallel.

```ts
import type { ReactNode } from 'react';
import type {
  SessionSummary, TurnModel, Entry, Turn,
  SessionInfo, ToolInfo, McpServerInfo, ManagedSessionDetail,
  HarnessConfig, HarnessConfigCustom, Facets,
  HarnessMeta, ModelOption, SessionConfig,
} from '@kayushkin/chat-core';

// Liveness of the global session-list SSE stream, as SyncEngine reports it. Separates
// "still connecting" from "you genuinely have no sessions", and says when the client has
// stopped receiving updates at all.
//
// The four values are not evenly likely: 'idle' is the window between mount and
// SyncEngine.start() (the boot prime runs first); 'connecting' covers the first attach AND
// every backoff reconnect, so a dropped stream reads as connecting; 'closed' is set only by
// SyncEngine.stop(), i.e. on unmount. The honest test for "updates are flowing" is
// `=== 'open'`, NOT `!== 'closed'`.

// Sidebar list, already filtered + grouped + sorted by the current filter/folder state.

// session the server still reports as running/holding but whose warm tail is terminal reads
// as completed/failed (F1 self-heal). Cold sessions return their raw summary state.
// `facets` are cross-axis counts over the FULL loaded session set (independent of the
// active filter), so the sidebar can render every available option + count and offer
// multi-select. Memoized on the sessions Map identity. (A `useFacets()` hook was NOT
// added — facets ride on `useSessionList` since the sidebar renders both together.)
//
// The list is ONE PAGE deep on boot (`sessionsPerPage`, default 100), because this box
// carries thousands of sessions and loading them all is the unbounded list the rewrite
// exists to kill. `moreSessions` is true while the server holds older sessions the client
// has not loaded, and `loadOlderSessions()` pulls the next cursor page and MERGES it —
// a sidebar that renders neither leaves every session past the first page unreachable.
// `total` counts the loaded-and-filter-passing rows and is never a server total: the
// summary endpoint reports no count, so "at least one more page" is the strongest honest
// claim. Filtering and `facets` are computed over the loaded window only, so paging is
// also what widens what a filter can reach.

// `send()` returns void and cannot throw, but it is no longer silent. It used to drop
// every failure — a `.finally()` with no `.catch` on the send path and a bare
// `.catch(() => {})` on the create path — so a refused message stayed on screen looking
// sent, the typed text was gone, and the spend-ceiling 402 was discarded before anything
// could read it. A failed send now puts the text back in the box (only when the box is
// still empty, so a message typed meanwhile is not clobbered), removes the optimistic row
// that was never sent, sets `error`, and records a spend halt when that is what the
// refusal was — read it back with useBudgetHalt(). On the create path the restore goes
// to the session the send TARGETED, not to the pending pane: createSession succeeded and
// setActive already moved the pane, so restoring under the pending key would put the text
// in a box nobody is looking at.
//
// `draft`/`setDraft` PERSIST. The draft map is written to localStorage on every keystroke
// (store/draftStorage.ts) and read back synchronously inside createChatStore, so a reload
// does not eat a half-typed message and the text is there in the first paint. The pending
// pane's draft is keyed under PENDING_DRAFT_KEY and cleared on send, so a sent new chat
// does not reappear in the next one. Setting '' deletes the persisted copy. The record is
// bounded by recency (MAX_PERSISTED_DRAFTS drafts, MAX_DRAFT_AGE_MS old) and by
// removeSession, NOT by "is this session in the sidebar" — the sidebar is paged, so a
// draft for a session outside the loaded window is still live. Pass
// `createChatStore({draftStorage})` to redirect or disable it (null); it is off wherever
// there is no working localStorage.
//
// `stop()` interrupts the running turn (POST /sessions/{id}/interrupt). It is a LOUD
// control: it throws on a non-2xx (e.g. the 409 the server returns while a tool still
// holds the turn), sets `error`, and does NOT optimistically mark the session idle —
// a failed stop must be visible, never swallowed into a fake-idle. `interrupting` is
// true for the request's duration. `paused` reflects a parked/held session (the
// explicit 'paused' state; never gate on a bare `state === 'running'` — `tool_running`
// is also busy). `error` is the last send/stop/resume error message, or null.
//
// `resume()` restarts a session whose harness process is gone (POST
// /sessions/{id}/resume), LOUD on the same terms as stop(). `resuming` is true for the
// request's duration. `resumable` is the gate: the server decides resumability from its
// live process registry (a session WITH a process gets a 409), and the client-visible
// proxy for "no process" is the state set in RESUMABLE_STATES — currently
// aborted/disconnected. It is deliberately NOT `paused`: nothing emits
// `msg.SessionPaused` today, so a control gated on it never renders. Interrupt also
// leaves the process registered, so an interrupted session is not resumable — it is
// idle, and sending to it continues it.

//
// The six faceted axes PERSIST. They are written to localStorage whenever a patch names
// one (store/filterStorage.ts) and read back synchronously inside createChatStore, so a
// reload paints the list already filtered rather than filtering it one frame later. The
// shape stored is chat-core's own INCLUSION arrays under `chat-core:filters` — NOT
// bridge-ui's exclusion keys, which mean the opposite and share an origin with dashv2.
// `search` and `folder` are deliberately never persisted: a restored query re-runs a

// ---- Session signals (the open questions a session is waiting on) ----
// A signal is the canonical record of anything a session surfaces to a human: a question
// that needs an answer, or a notification that needs at most an acknowledgement
// (llm-bridge `msg/signal.go`). `SessionSignals` is mounted inside the RefChip session
// panel, so opening session A's chip while working in session B answers A's question in
// place. It ships no CSS: stable unhashed `signal-*` classes, styled by the host.
//
// Answering is ONE door: POST /signals/{id}/answer, keyed by signal id, whichever producer
// raised the question and whether or not the session is still running. The client used to
// choose the transport — refetch the parked tool input and post it to the hook route, or
// post text to /send — on evidence it does not have: a requestId says a park EXISTED, not
// that it is still live. The server picks now, and the title-keyed pairing a parked hook
// needs is derived where the parked input already lives. Dismiss is the SIGNAL-level verb
// (POST /signals/{id}/resolve {state:'dismissed'}), and the server reads it the same way:
// it denies a live parked call and closes a dead one. Acknowledge is that verb with
// `acknowledged`, which the server refuses for a QUESTION on purpose — a question nobody
// answered has not been handled.
//
// How a card answers:
//   pick-one     — plain buttons that SEND on the click, with no Submit and no radios: a
//                  radio holds a choice until a Submit, and there is none to hold it for.
//                  Only when the request holds this question and no other, because one
//                  AskUserQuestion call resolves ONCE with every answer together.
//   pick-many    — checkboxes plus a Submit, driven off `allowMultipleOptions` and never
//                  inferred from the option count. A pick-many answer is comma-joined,
//                  which is what the tool's own schema takes.
//   any option   — rewritable in place. The editor opens on the LABEL (the words you are
//                  amending; a machine `value` cannot be amended into a sentence) and the
//                  rewritten text is what goes on the wire. An untouched pick still sends
//                  `value || label`.
//   freeform     — a textarea, for every question that has no editable option to rewrite
//                  instead. Never gated on `allowFreeform`: `signalFromWire` defaults that
//                  to FALSE when the key is absent, so honouring it fails closed onto an
//                  unanswerable card.
//
// `compact` trims chrome (descriptions, body) for tight surfaces and never the means of
// answering. `startCollapsedToAnswers` opens a card on its answers alone, with a
// disclosure for the question — for a chat pane, whose transcript already carries the
// question directly above. That one also drops the freeform box wherever the question HAS
// options, because each option is editable. ⚠️ A host's composer is not the fallback: a
// bare POST /sessions/{id}/send deliberately leaves a tool-parked question open, because
// the harness is blocked on its hook and not on stdin.
//
// A 404 from /signals means this bridge-server predates the feature: the read answers
// `null` (never `[]`, which would say "deployed and quiet") and every surface renders
// nothing rather than erroring. Reads dedupe through a 30s promise cache like the chip
// loaders, and every resolve announces in-process so other mounted surfaces refetch.

// backs useSessionInfo + useManagedSession. setPermissionMode() PUTs

### ApiClient — controls-bar additions (all LOUD: throw on any non-2xx)

Mirror the exact canonical bridge endpoints (verified against bridge-ui `useBridgeSession.ts`).
`createSession`/`fork` read the id from the canonical `session_id` wire key (POST /sessions and
/fork return the snake_case `msg.ManagedSession`; there is no `sessionId` on that shape).

```ts
// class ApiClient {
//   createSession(opts?: { instanceId?; harness? }): Promise<CreatedSession>; // maps session_id → sessionId
//   compact(id: string, summary?: string): Promise<unknown>;                   // POST /sessions/{id}/compact — {} or { summary }
//   fork(id: string, displayName?: string): Promise<CreatedSession>;           // POST /sessions/{id}/fork — { display_name, type:'interactive' }
//   switchMode(id: string, mode: 'events'|'pty'): Promise<unknown>;            // POST /sessions/{id}/mode — { mode }
//   setConfig(id: string, config: SessionConfig): Promise<unknown>;           // POST /sessions/{id}/config — { model?, effort?, max_budget?, disabled_tools? }
//   getHarnesses(): Promise<HarnessMeta[]>;                                     // GET /harnesses (canonical harness registry)
//   getModels(): Promise<ModelOption[]>;                                       // GET /models (enabled rows → ModelOption)
// }
```

Pure, framework-free selectors (exported for non-React consumers/tests):
`harnessCapabilities(harnesses, harnessId) → Set<string>` and
`modelsForHarness(models, harnesses, harnessId?) → ModelOption[]` — both read the canonical
registry lists, never a hardcoded allowlist.

Notes for implementers:
- All hooks read via Zustand selector subscriptions so only components whose slice changed
  re-render.
- `select()` / filter changes / `newSession` / `archive` must never await the network on the
  path that updates the UI.
- `useTurns(view:'raw')` and `sourcesFor` are the audit surface — they must expose every
  stored copy (see WIRE.md non-destructive dedup).
- Pure reconcile helpers are also exported for non-React consumers/tests:
  `terminalStateFromTail(model)` and `effectiveState(state, sessionId)` /
  `activeSummaryEffective(state)` (see WIRE.md "Client terminal-state reconcile").
